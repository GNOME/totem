Automatic GStreamer codec installation (optional)
================================================================
- requires GStreamer core and gst-plugins-base >= 0.10.12
- calls (via GStreamer) a predefined external helper script (which is to be
  installed by the distro and can be defined via gst-plugins-base's configure
  script when building gst-plugins-base) with details of missing GStreamer
  plugins. See
  http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gst-plugins-base-libs/html/gst-plugins-base-libs-gstpbutilsinstallplugins.html#id511743
  for more information on how this all works together.
