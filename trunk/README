- rtsp plugin for xine?
http://www.live.com/liveMedia/#testProgs
- finish vanity

GStreamer backend TODO
======================
- deinterlacing
- network connection speed (mmsh://, http://, rtsp://...)

Easy GStreamer plugin installation via libgimme-codec (optional)
================================================================
- requires GStreamer core and gst-plugins-base >= 0.10.12
- libgimme-codec is a very thing wrapper library to call a predefined external
  helper script with details of missing GStreamer plugins, it can be obtained
  from http://desrt.mcmaster.ca/code/libgimme-codec/
  The library on its own is not very useful, since it does not provide the
  actual external helper that does the package installation or suggests what
  to install.
- for more information, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/EasyCodecInstallation
  and the links referenced there.
